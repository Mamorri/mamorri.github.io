<p class="indent">"I just wanted to let you know that I used my skidschool skills today, and they saved me from a head-on collision at over 100 km/hr. There was a car dead stopped facing the wrong way on the Queensway! I have never heard of that happening before. It was really, really close. I tried to brake but there wasn't enough time to stop, and I was going too fast - it was just like the last exerciseof the day that we did in your class! I quickly flipped the steering wheel to the right, just like you taught me. Thankfully the van had slowed down enough that I had enough space to get over in front of it. I was so close to a head-on. If I hadn't been in such a similar situation before in your class, I don't know what I would have done. I wanted to say thanks - I think that your class saved my life (literally)!"

<p class="indent">"Thank you on behalf of myself, my wife Patti and our shuttle bus driver Sam Morini at JACK MAY PONITAC BUICK for making us all safer drivers."

<p class="indent">"On July 5th this year, my subconscious memory was put to the test and I am very happy to be able to write to you and thank you for saving me and my son, Matt, from injury and possibly death in a car accident we were involved in on the Queensway. I'd like to commend you, Bob, on the work you're doing to make safer drivers on the road, and to thank you again for saving Matt and I."

<p class="indent">"As I was turning right onto a highway a car in the oncomming lane pulled out to pass - I swerved onto the shoulder of the road and did an Off Road Recovery. I know if I hadn't gone to your skid school that would have been a head on collision with my fully loaded school bus."
<div class="name"><em><b>~Shirley Thomlinson</b></em></div></p>

<hr>

<p class="indent">"The training you gave us in an absolute essential for everyone who drives a car."

<p class="indent">"On the northern outskirts of Nashville (the Interstate has 8 lanes), I was driving 1 lane to the right of the fast lane in medium traffic. It was about 10 am when the tractor trailer in front of us in the lane to my right cut us off. I checked the mirror and pulled around its tail. I then immediately noticed that there was a full sized couch dead in the middle of THAT lane - yes a couch! I calmly checked the mirror and pulled to the left of the couch, onto the paved shoulder. I drove around the couch and then back into the proper lane. The big 3/4 Ton with loaded trailer faithfully followed and all was well. I wasn't nervous and didn't even sweat or get nervous after things got back to normal. It was sort of weird. It was just another manouver from AP driving school. All went well. An interesting event that could have gone wrong but didn't because of the skills I learned in your car on your track."

<p class="indent">"Just like the kid who fell off the curb in front of me and I just steered around him where I might have just slammed on the brakes and hit him. Your course does it again!"
