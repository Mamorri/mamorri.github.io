<div id="formwrap">
<button class="accordion">Are the techniques I'll be learning up to date?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>You will Learn &amp; Practice up to date skills and techniques required to handle the most common emergency driving situations. These techniques have been developed in today's modern vehicles - the techniques are not from the past generation of vehicles which operated &amp; handled differently.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">What sort of techniques will I be learning?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>How to CONTROL direction and speed individually, the difference between "LOSS OF TRACTION" and "LOSS OF CONTROL," keeping your foot ON the GAS while you are sliding is not a choice but a necessity to regain &amp; maintain CONTROL of your vehicle, the difference between SLIDING and SKIDDING, how to "SLOW DOWN" as "QUICKLY as POSSIBLE" rather than STOPPING as quick as possible resulting in perfect CONTROLLED Emergency stops.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Should I be concerned about my age or experience?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>You don't have to be concerned about your age or driving experience, since these techniques are new to all drivers everyone starts on equal footing.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Will I be compared/tested with other drivers?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>You will not be Tested or compared to others. Our only grading system measures EFFORT. Everyone completes our program and becomes a safer driver unless they are not willing to learn &amp; put out the effort. In this occasional situation the student is removed from the program so as to not interfere with those wanting to learn. (No Money refunded ). We also work with challenged drivers, post stroke and post traumatic individuals.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Will I learn to be a safer driver?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>YOU will learn how to safely make swerving moves around things in YOUR path, and that when YOU find YOURSELF in a bad situation for whatever reason, NO-ONE and NOTHING can create more space for YOU to get out of trouble. </p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Will I learn to be an instinctually better driver?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>YOU will learn how to operate your vehicle by FEEL. Not by trying to figure out what is happening and then trying to decide what to do about it. By the time this is accomplished the emergency has developed into an uncontrollable situation.</p>
